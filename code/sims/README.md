### [code/sims](./code/sims)

Contains all code used in the simulation study in the main text of the manuscript.

+ `main-full-sim.R`: script to run simulations for all candidate models when the species-environment relationship was generated from the "Full" scenario.
+ `main-interaction-sim.R`: script to run simulations for all candidate models when the species-environmetn relationship was assumed to interact with a known variable.
+ `main-linear-sim.R`: script to run simulations for all candidate models when the species-environment was generated as a linear relationship.
+ `main-missing-sim.R`: script to run simulations for all candidate models when the species-environment relationships was generated as an interaction with a missing variable.
+ `main-quadratic-sim.R`: script to run simulations for all candidate models when the species-environment relationship was generated as a a quadratic relationship.
+ `main-strata-sim.R`: script to run simulations for all candidate models when the species-environment relationship was generated as varying across nine pre-specified strata.
+ `summary-sim.R`: script to summarize the results from all simulation scenarios and to generate Figure 1in the manuscript.
