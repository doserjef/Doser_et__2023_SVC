### [code/supplemental-sims](./code/supplemental-sims) 

Contains all code used to run the simulation studies in Supplemenetal Information S4.

+ `main-sim-1.R`: runs a simulation study to assess sample size impacts on single-season SVC models.
+ `main-sim-2.R`: runs a simulation study to assess sample size impacts on multi-season SVC models.
+ `main-sim-3.R`: runs a simulation study to assess sample size impacts for assessing spatially-varying population trends.
+ `main-sim-4.R`: runs a simulation study to assess the effect of detection probability and the amount of replication on estimates from an SVC occupancy model.
+ `summary-sim-1.R`: script that summarizes results from the first supplemental simulation study.
+ `summary-sim-2.R`: script that summarizes results from the second supplemental simulation study.
+ `summary-sim-3.R`: script that summarizes results from the third supplemental simulation study.
+ `summary-sim-4.R`: script that summarizes results from the fourth supplemental simulation study.
